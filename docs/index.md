## What is Solarplexus?

Solarplexus is a plugin aimed for developers of complex custom Wordpress websites. Solarplexus is made for giving developers a powerful tool for adding dynamic display blocks (as in “various ways of displaying content [in a page/post] that is residing in other areas of your website”).

We created Solarplexus because when building websites that stays close to Core (i.e. accepts and celebrates the new Wordpress Block Editor (a.k.a. Gutenberg) there was a clear need for a standardized of bringing life to feed based websites also in the new era of Wordpress.

Solarplexus is created by Äventyret – a leading Wordpress (and much more) agency in Sweden – as our way to give back to the Wordpress community that has given us so much. Solarplexus is open source software free to use for anyone*

_* Bare in mind Solarplexus is not the most graspable plugin around (at least not yet, hence why we call it a “developer plugin”) so you probably need a few years of experience in Wordpress development if you want to use it sucessfully._

## Gutenberg on Steroids

We think the Block editor (a.k.a Gutenberg) is a great idea while not yet a great implementation. Building Wordpress websites in an agency environment since 2003, we – a group of developers – were missing a (for us) central piece of the puzzle: blocks displaying content from other parts of the same website.

Solarplexus is our solution to the problem. With the Solarplexus plugin a developer can create a custom set of blocks through writing just a few lines of code.
