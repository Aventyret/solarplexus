## What is Solarplexus?

Solarplexus gives developers a powerful tool for adding **dynamic display blocks** (as in “various ways of displaying content [in a page/post] that is residing in other areas of your website”).

We created Solarplexus because when building websites that stays **close to Core** (i.e. accepts and celebrates the Block Editor) there was a clear need for a standardized way of bringing life to feed based websites.

Solarplexus is created by [Äventyret](https://aventyret.com) – a leading Wordpress (and much more) agency in Sweden – as our way to give back to the Wordpress community that has given us so much. Solarplexus is open source software free to use for anyone.

## Who is it for?

Out of the box the plugin provides two dynamic display blocks. To make full use of the powers of Solarplexus' ability to create custom display blocks with just a few lines of code – please read the [configuration guide](/guide/config.html).

## The missing core component for dynamic display blocks 💪

Building Wordpress websites in an agency environment since 2003, we – a group of developers – were missing a (for us) central piece of the puzzle: blocks displaying content from other parts of the same website.

        Solarplexus borrows its name from the iconic Swedish jazz rock band Solar Plexus, founded 1969. Pioneering the genre of ‘acid jazz’ Solar Plexus were famous for playing a mix between folk music, prog and psychadelica. And since Wordpress names all major releases after jazz legends, we – being Swedish– thought it would be suitable to name our contribution to the community after the Swedish leading contributors to jazz (with a folky rock n’ roll twist).

        The celiac plexus, also known as the solar plexus because of its radiating nerve fibers, is a complex network of nerves (a nerve plexus) located in the abdomen, near where the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and renal arteries branch from the abdominal aorta. Or as we would say: close to the Core.
