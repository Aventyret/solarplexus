## What is Solarplexus?

**Solarplexus** is a plugin aimed for developers of complex custom Wordpress websites. Solarplexus gives developers a powerful tool for adding **dynamic display blocks** (as in ‚Äúvarious ways of displaying content [in a page/post] that is residing in other areas of your website‚Äù).

We created Solarplexus because when building websites that stays **close to Core** (i.e. accepts and celebrates the new Wordpress Block Editor (a.k.a. Gutenberg) there was a clear need for a standardized way of bringing life to feed based websites also in the new era of Wordpress.

Solarplexus is created by [√Ñventyret](https://aventyret.com) ‚Äì a leading Wordpress (and much more) agency in Sweden ‚Äì as our way to give back to the Wordpress community that has given us so much. Solarplexus is open source software free to use for anyone.*

_* Bare in mind Solarplexus is not the most graspable plugin around (at least not yet, hence why we call it a ‚Äúdeveloper plugin‚Äù) so you probably need a few years of experience in Wordpress development if you want to use it sucessfully._

## Gutenberg on Steroids üí™

We think the Block editor (a.k.a Gutenberg) is a great idea while not yet a great implementation. Building Wordpress websites in an agency environment since 2003, we ‚Äì a group of developers ‚Äì were missing a (for us) central piece of the puzzle: blocks displaying content from other parts of the same website.

Solarplexus is **our solution to the problem**. With the Solarplexus plugin a developer can create a custom set of blocks through writing just a few lines of code.

        Solarplexus borrows its name from the iconic Swedish jazz rock band Solar Plexus, founded 1969. Pioneering the genre of ‚Äòacid jazz‚Äô Solar Plexus were famous for playing a mix between folk music, prog and psychadelica. And since Wordpress names all major releases after jazz legends, we ‚Äì being Swedish‚Äì thought it would be suitable to name our contribution to the community after the Swedish leading contributors to jazz (with a folky rock n‚Äô roll twist).

        The celiac plexus, also known as the solar plexus because of its radiating nerve fibers, is a complex network of nerves (a nerve plexus) located in the abdomen, near where the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and renal arteries branch from the abdominal aorta. Or as we would say: close to the Core.
