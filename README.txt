Solarplexus gives developers a powerful tool for adding dynamic display blocks.

== Description ==

Solarplexus gives developers a powerful tool for adding dynamic display blocks (as in “various ways of displaying content [in a page/post] that is residing in other areas of your website”).

We created Solarplexus because when building websites that stays close to Core (i.e. accepts and celebrates the Block Editor) there was a clear need for a standardized way of bringing life to feed based websites.

= Who is it for? =

Out of the box the plugin provides two dynamic display blocks. To make full use of the powers of Solarplexus' ability to create custom display blocks with just a few lines of code – please read the configuration guide.

= The missing core component for dynamic display blocks =

Building Wordpress websites in an agency environment since 2003, we – a group of developers – were missing a (for us) central piece of the puzzle: blocks displaying content from other parts of the same website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What perks does Solarplexus have? =

Here are four:
- Create dynamic or handpicked lists of articles (or other post types) to be displayed on Block editor based pages/posts
- Support for Sage or standard theme development
- Powerful customization
- Lightning fast setup

= Can I use Solarplexus without Sage? =

Yes!
