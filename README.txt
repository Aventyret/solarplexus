A plugin and developer tool to easily create Gutenberg blocks for creating dynamic and static lists of posts, pages and more.

== Description ==

Solarplexus is a plugin aimed at Wordpress developers, specifically designed to help out with a common concept that is often re-invented for every new website - referring to other content on that website. Well-known concepts such as a list of the latest posts of a custom post type, or simply a hand picked list of highlighted posts, is not entirely trivial when just using what's offered in Wordpress core.

Solarplexus makes this easy by reading a simple configuration from your theme, and generating Gutenberg blocks ready to be used by the editors without further programming. The plugin is designed to be highly developer-customizable, while still being perfectly usable with some default settings for simpler projects.

It includes support for themes based on the Roots Sage boilerplate.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip to `/wp-content/plugins/solarplexus` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
